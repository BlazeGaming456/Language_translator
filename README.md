This was a project to develop the Front-End Infrastructure for a text-translation website. It has been built mainly using React.js and Tailwind CSS.
Using LibreTranslate API, or any other Translation API, we can implement translation functionality to the website.

Task Report:
The app mainly consists of four components - the navbar,text section, information section and the footer.
Here, the main part is the text section which is where the majority of the functionality takes place. We can select the required source and target languages and change settings according to user preference. We can clear the input sections, given input by voice and see the character count of the input. We can also copy the translated text to our clipboard.
Many other functionalities can be implemented to expand the website and amke it part of a bigger project.
